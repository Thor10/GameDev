## About the Game:
Ok, so you are on another planet, your job, bust all the ghosts, but with changing ancient weapons of course. The game is a platformer made using Pygame and Python. I also removed the music mainly
because it was increasing the size of the folder but it can be found in the original version of
the game on itch.io.
