This github contains all the code for my **Pygame 2** tutorial series which can be found here: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLCqWq4vJTZacpphiH2bTCjc5Za-aq70mr

Also be sure to have Python 3.7 or above installed on your machine

Be sure to run pip or pip3 depending on your machine: 
```
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```
You could also just run
```
pip3 install pygame==2.0.0
```

I also have a video in the playlist which shows you how to install Pygame 2 and Python 3.9: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWEznXJA7Rc&list=PLCqWq4vJTZacpphiH2bTCjc5Za-aq70mr&index=1&t=247s
