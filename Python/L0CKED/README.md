## About the Game:
This game was made for 2 Game Jams but I ended up removing it from the second game jam since they did not allow submissions for 2 game jams. Itch.io Link: https://devhedronyt.itch.io/l0cked. Here is a link to my devlog: https://youtu.be/0HB5qW1fd5Y. It was made using Pygame 2.0.1 and Python 3.9.1. Also my second game of 2021 :)
