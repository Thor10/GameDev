## About the Game:
*EPILEPSY WARNING, PLAY AT YOUR OWN RISK, SOME OF THE EFFECTS IN THE GAME MAY HURT YOU!* Play as a circle and try to destroy as many other circles as possible! The game was made using Pygame and Python and most of the game was made by a friend and I just fixed bugs for him and added polishing. To contact him, on Discord: Jet Omnivore#6620

## 3rd Party Assets Used in the Game:

Most of the art was made by me except for the music and the fonts, they can be found here, I 
ended up removing the music though it is still in the original itch.io version:
