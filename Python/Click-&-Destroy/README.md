## About the Game:
This game was made for Brackeys Game Jam 2021.1. It was made in about 3-4 days. Itch.io Link: https://devhedronyt.itch.io/clickdestroy. Here is a link to my devlog: https://youtu.be/hBgdsQgmKyM. It was made using Pygame 2.0.1 and Python 3.9.1. There might be some grammatical errors as well.... :)

In this open source version to cut down on size I removed the music though it still exists in
the itch.io version
